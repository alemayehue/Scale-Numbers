Test Plan:

In order to test the program we will have a long list of digits represented as strings in a text file that will be read by the program bignum.cxx

In order to test that the capacity of bignum is correctly surpassed and executes normally, we must perform some boundary and normal test cases.
Normal test cases include a wide array of random numbers within the capacity and the same for an array of numbers outside of the capacity.

Boundary Test Cases Include:

(+) Number Below Capacity
(-) Number Below Capacity
(+) Number Above Capacity
(-) Number Above Capacity

(+) Single Digit Number
(-) Single Digit Number

Input has leading zeros
Input is Zero

Input that includes a letter/other character
Input that has a sign with no digits
Input that is empty
